The idea of this work of object oriented programming course was to create a system for the management of a zoo that would allow the deletion and creation of new objects such as habitats, workers, animal species, visitors and other objects, in order to know the current status of the zoo. An implementation was made in Java which has a console interface and another in Python where the GUI is made with the tkinter library.
